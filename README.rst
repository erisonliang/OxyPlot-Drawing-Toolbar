============================
OxyPlot Drawing Toolbar Demo
============================

.. note:: This is still the initial commit! I'll remove this line when it's fully up on git.

Description
-----------

An example of using mouse events and annotations together to create a drawing toolbar with `OxyPlot`_. Feel free to use
any way you'd like! It was designed mostly because I wanted to add a drawing feature to a graph display on an in house
application where I work. This was mainly so that they could draw on a chart without exporting it to an image or
printing it first, with the added bonus of being able to display info below series if they want.

Please let me know if you find any issues, or even if there's a better way of doing something in the code~! I'm always
open to being told I'm doing it wrong, as it's just another reason to learn better ways to improve how I code =).

Usage
-----

You can just pull out the ``ChartDrawingToolStrip`` files, throw them in a new project and build it, then it SHOULD show
up in the ToolBox. Let me know if there are any issues and I'll play with it.
